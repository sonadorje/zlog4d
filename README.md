# zlog4d
zlog is a reliable, high-performance, thread safe, flexible, clear-model, pure pascal logging library.

Actually, in the pascal world there was NO good logging library for applications like log4j in java or log4cxx in c++. Using printf can work, but can not be redirected or reformatted easily. So I translated zlog source code to pascal. It is faster, safer and more powerful than log4d. So it can be widely used.
